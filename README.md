Web_Relays
==================

Arduino powered Relay controller with HTTP POST API, self hosted web control panel.

Requirements
------------

-	[Webduino](https://github.com/sirleech/Webduino) which is used to provide a better HTTP server on the Arduino
-	[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is used for the web control page, however all that is requiered is a connection to the internet on the client as the JS is pulled from the jQuery site
-	There is possibly more, I will update the list as I find them
